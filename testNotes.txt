newFrictionEnvFirstTry_20251125_104704_1, this was the first attempt with the new friction env. 
It works quite well at 700 it/s. So far the training is progressing exactly as the previous env did.
I will see how performance compares between the two on the fixed env and the varying env.

 PandaPickAndPlace-v3_20251125_022727_1  this is the best run on the pick and place. rewards and performance plateua
 around 40 minute/2M steps mark. 

 hypothesis, no magic sensor + varying friction should mean it treats every object like it is ice
 which means it would probably be more delicate, and then lead to an improved 

 make a mention of HER for paper padding. I think it helps with the sparse rewards of a long Trajectory
 This is why HER is essential - with sparse rewards, random exploration almost never gets a positive signal. HER creates "fake" successes by relabeling achieved goals.


 So future design paths:
 Use the dense rewards
 dont use HER
 after computing the no magic sensor on varying friction, add different shapes
 add objects
 ADD WRIST MOTION, my current hypothesis is that if friction is too low you
 would have to have some wrist motion.
 Use a T shaped object, set friction to 0, you could only pick up from the bottom side.
